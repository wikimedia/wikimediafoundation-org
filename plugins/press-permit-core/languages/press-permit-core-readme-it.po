msgid "By default, WordPress only allows Administrators to create users. If you want to allow other roles to create users then you need to give them at least the promote_users, list_users, edit_users and create_users permissions. However, if you give them those permissions, they can create and edit users in any role. So you could have Editors creating and editing Administrator accounts. That could be a security problem. Fortunately, PublishPress Permissions has a feature called “Limit User Edit by Level”. This prevents anyone from editing a user with a higher level or assigning a role higher than their own."
msgstr "Per impostazione predefinita, WordPress consente solo agli amministratori di creare utenti. Se vuoi permettere ad altri ruoli di creare utenti, allora devi dare loro almeno le autorizzazioni promote_users, list_users, edit_users e create_users. Tuttavia, se dai loro queste autorizzazioni, possono creare e modificare utenti in qualsiasi ruolo. Quindi potreste avere dei redattori che creano e modificano account di amministratore. Questo potrebbe essere un problema di sicurezza. Fortunatamente, PublishPress Permissions ha una funzione chiamata \"Limita la modifica degli utenti per livello\". Questo impedisce a chiunque di modificare un utente con un livello superiore o di assegnare un ruolo superiore al proprio."

msgid "By default, all the files and images you upload to WordPress are publicly available. This is great news for most sites. The goal of most sites is to create popular content that is viewed by as many readers as possible. But this public access is a problem if you run a membership site and DO NOT want everyone reading your content. Yes, you can restrict the privacy of your posts, but people can still view your files if they know the URL. The PublishPress Permissions Pro plugin makes it possible to block direct access to your media files. Even if someone knows the URL, they won't be able to access your files unless you give them the correct access."
msgstr "Per impostazione predefinita, tutti i file e le immagini che carichi su WordPress sono disponibili pubblicamente. Questa è una grande notizia per la maggior parte dei siti. L'obiettivo della maggior parte dei siti è quello di creare contenuti popolari che siano visti da quanti più lettori possibile. Ma questo accesso pubblico è un problema se gestisci un sito di appartenenza e non vuoi che tutti leggano i tuoi contenuti. Sì, puoi limitare la privacy dei tuoi articoli, ma le persone possono comunque visualizzare i tuoi file se conoscono l'URL. Il plugin PublishPress Permissions Pro permette di bloccare l'accesso diretto ai tuoi file media. Anche se qualcuno conosce l'URL, non sarà in grado di accedere ai tuoi file a meno che tu non gli dia l'accesso corretto."

msgid "This guide will show you how to require users to create content in a specific category or parent page. The solution in this guide is a flexible approach for sites with a substantial number of users in different roles. Depending on the needs of your site, the PublishPress plugins also offer other approaches such as this one based on user roles. In this tutorial, we'll use examples from a university. Our sample site has categories for different university departments. Our aim will be to restrict some users to posting in some categories, or underneath some parent pages. By default, Categories are only available on WordPress Posts. However, you can add Categories to other post types and so you will be able to use the tutorial for those post types too."
msgstr "Questa guida ti mostrerà come richiedere agli utenti di creare contenuti in una specifica categoria o pagina genitore. La soluzione in questa guida è un approccio flessibile per i siti con un numero sostanziale di utenti in ruoli diversi. A seconda delle esigenze del tuo sito, i plugin di PublishPress offrono anche altri approcci come questo basato sui ruoli degli utenti. In questo tutorial, useremo esempi da un'università. Il nostro sito di esempio ha categorie per diversi dipartimenti universitari. Il nostro obiettivo sarà quello di limitare alcuni utenti a pubblicare in alcune categorie, o sotto alcune pagine genitori. Per impostazione predefinita, le categorie sono disponibili solo sugli articoli di WordPress. Tuttavia, è possibile aggiungere Categorie ad altri tipi di contenuto e quindi sarete in grado di utilizzare il tutorial anche per quei tipi di contenuto."

So we're going to control who can see this content. By default, Categories are only available on WordPress Posts. However, you can add Categories to other post types and so you will be able to use the tutorial for those post types too."
msgstr "Sì, PublishPress Permissions permette di controllare chi può visualizzare e leggere contenuti con una categoria specifica. In questa situazione, \"leggere\" significa \"vedere\".

msgid "A large number of WordPress have sites with custom post types. These custom post types often hold sensitive information. In this guide, we'll show you how to control who can read, edit and publish content in your custom post types. By default, nearly all custom post types will inherit the same permissions as Posts. So a user in the “Editor” will role will automatically be able to write and edit in your custom post type."
msgstr "Un gran numero di WordPress ha siti con tipi di contenuto personalizzati. Questi tipi di contenuto personalizzati spesso contengono informazioni sensibili. In questa guida, vi mostreremo come controllare chi può leggere, modificare e pubblicare contenuti nei vostri tipi di contenuto personalizzati. Per impostazione predefinita, quasi tutti i tipi di contenuto personalizzati ereditano le stesse autorizzazioni degli articoli. Quindi un utente con il ruolo di \"Editore\" sarà automaticamente in grado di scrivere e modificare nel tuo tipo di contenuto personalizzato."
