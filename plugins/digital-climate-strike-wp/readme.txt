This plugin allows anyone with a WordPress site to join the Digital #ClimateStrike with a few clicks. It is a banner that informs visitors about the Global Climate Strike on September 20th and directs them to join the strike.

== Description ==
# Digital Climate Strike

This September, millions of us will walk out of our workplaces and homes to join young climate strikers on the streets and demand an end to the age of fossil fuels.

The Digital Climate Strike's Wordpress plugin will allow anyone with a website to join the digital climate strike in solidarity. [Click here to learn more.](https://globalclimatestrike.net)

## How it works & Demo

When you install this plugin and enable the Digital Strike widget via Settings in your Wordpress admin, it will show a footer banner ([demo](https://assets.digitalclimatestrike.net/demo.html)) informing visitors that your site is supporting the Global Climate Strike and directs them to also join the strike:

Then at midnight on September 20th for 24 hours, the banner will expand to be full screen ([demo](https://assets.digitalclimatestrike.net/demo.html?fullPage)), showing an unavoidable message that your site is joining the Global #ClimateStrike for the day, directing them to join the Global Climate Strike movement:

For those who cannot shut down their website for the day, a closable overlay option can also be configured ([demo](https://assets.digitalclimatestrike.net/demo.html?fullPage&showCloseButton)):

The widget is designed to appear once per user, per device, per day, but can be configured to display at a different interval.

Please take a look at [**widget.js**](https://github.com/global-climate-strikes/digital-climate-strike/blob/master/static/widget.js) if you want to see exactly what you\'re embedding on your page.

The widget is compatible with Firefox, Chrome (desktop and mobile), Safari (desktop and mobile), Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
