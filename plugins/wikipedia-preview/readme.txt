Some sections of your site may be enhanced by adding a lot of links; other sections of your site might not need any.
Take a few minutes to add links retroactively to your existing content, and take just a few seconds to add links to new content as you create it in the future. Your visitors will thank you!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Wikipedia Preview free? =

= Does Wikipedia Preview work on any word? =

The Wikipedia Preview works with any word or phrase that has an article on Wikipedia, in any of the available languages.

= What is the flow for implementing the Wikipedia Preview links in a post? =

When writing articles, decide which words show a Wikipedia popup on a particular post. The process of enabling the Wikipedia popup on a specific word is identical to [adding a hyperlink](https://wordpress.org/support/article/paragraph-block/#insert-hyperlinks).

= After the implementation of Wikipedia Preview will there be any impact on the size of the page? Will it get laggy? =

The words that will have a Wikipedia Preview popup on your site need to be annotated. Those annotations add to the page size but not more than the regular hyperlinks you already use.

= How does one customise the preview style? =

In the admin site, go to “Appearance / customize”, then select the “Additional CSS” option from the left side menu. In the text box, the following CSS should reset the existing term style so you can adjust it to your liking.

~~~
.wmf-wp-with-preview {
    border: 0;
    background-color: unset;
    padding: unset;
}
.wmf-wp-with-preview::after {
    content: '';
}
~~~
