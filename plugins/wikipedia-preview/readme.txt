Wikipedia Preview lets you show a popup card with a short summary from Wikipedia when a reader clicks or hovers over a link.

== Description ==

Enhance your website with free knowledge straight from Wikipedia!

Install Wikipedia Preview, the free add-on designed to better engage your visitors and improve the user experience on your website.

The Wikipedia Preview plugin provides context to your site’s visitors with content directly from Wikipedia. It allows you to add links to your content so that when your visitors click or hover on them, they see a pop-up box with information and images straight from Wikipedia. With Wikipedia Preview your visitors gain context on a topic, without ever leaving your website.

Wikipedia Preview is an official plug-in designed and developed by the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), the non-profit behind Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects.

The plug-in is entirely free to download and use, in line with the Wikimedia Foundation’s mission to provide free knowledge for everyone.

The Wikipedia Preview works with any word or phrase that has an article on Wikipedia, in any of the available languages.

= What is the flow for implementing the Wikipedia Preview links in a post? =

When writing articles, decide which words show a Wikipedia popup on a particular post. The process of enabling the Wikipedia popup on a specific word is identical to [adding a hyperlink](https://wordpress.org/support/article/paragraph-block/#insert-hyperlinks).
