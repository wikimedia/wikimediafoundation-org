Wikimedia's Shiro Theme
===

This theme was originally forked from the Reaktiv Studios starter theme and [Underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) with quite a few additions. The following documentation runs through the basics of the theme and any commands you may need to follow.

Folder Structure
---------------
The basic folder structure keeps things fairly simple and organized by type.

The `assets` folder contains front-end files in the `src` sub-directory. Any files that need to be concatenated are output into `dist` and files are enqueued by the theme from there.

The `inc` folder contains all PHP files that aren't required in the root directory by WordPress.

The `template-parts` folder contains template parts used by larger templates in the root directory.

Build Process
---------------
This theme uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) & [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) for all its build process needs. They will help you to concatenate, lint and build your files. This also includes livereload, which will automatically inject CSS changes, and reload the live page whenever changes are made to JS or PHP files.

In order to make sure your development environment works the way it should, drop this into your `wp-config.php` file.

```
define( 'RKV_ENV', 'local' );
```

The following tasks are available to you:

* `npm run build`
This builds out the assets and runs the following tasks: `styles`, `scripts`

* `npm run lint`
Lints all file types and runs the following tasks: `csslint`, `jslint` `phplint`

* `npm run start`
Begins watching front-end assets (scripts and styles) and compiles them when changed. This will also start the livereload script, which refreshes the page when changes are made.

* `npm run download-style-guide-sass`
Download the variables file in the style-guide. This is only required when the style guide has changed.

CSS
---------------
CSS should follow the BEM naming convention and files should be clearly commented.

JS
---------------
JS should follow the [WordPress coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/javascript/). In addition, please use [JSDoc](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/require-jsdoc) when commenting on functions.

PHP
---------------
PHP should follow the [WordPress coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/). PHP Codesniffer is configured in `wp-content/.phpcs.xml.dist`.

Icons
---------------
An SVG icon system has been included as a sprite sheet generated by gulp with `gulp svg`. In order to keep the file size of this sprite down, only icons which are added to the theme's `assets/src/svg/individual` folder are compiled and included in this sprite file. The compiled icon sprite is located at `assets/dist/icons.svg`. Instructions on how to add additional icons to this sprite are included below.

##### Using icons in the theme
The helper function `wmf_show_icon` is available to make using icons as simple as possible. The parameters for this function are the name of the SVG to display and optional classes to add. The name matches the name of the original SVG file.

````php
wmf_show_icon( 'search' );
````

When the SVG is output, it will include the `icon` and `icon-{icon-name}` CSS classes so that it can be targeted and styled.
