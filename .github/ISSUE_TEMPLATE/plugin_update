### Goal
Perform a monthly plug-in update and confirm that it didn't break anything noticeable on the site.

### Details
We want to provide regular plug-in updates for the site as older versions can cause issues within the sites.

Two ways VIP does updates

1. Symbolic link - points WM plug-in directory to VIP master repo - some plug-ins are in there because the whole plug-in is hosted within the repo
2. Others are hosted locally on the site.

VIP makes it confusing to update plug-ins. 

- The plug-ins with a file are in the VIP library and are automatically updated
- The plug-ins installed manually, we will need to download the update and upload as a patch.

HM needs to look at plug-in updates and see if we can figure out how to manually update the plug-ins where needed. [View documentation](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/plugins/). Chris is available to meet with KAdam/Alexis on updates if needed.

@kadamwhite Did this for the Diff site, so if you run into any issues with VIP, ping him.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Plug-ins are up-to-date
- [ ] Nothing appears to be broken on the site
